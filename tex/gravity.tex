{\Large Gravitational Waves}

\begin{itemize}

\item Gravity is the mysterious force which holds large objects together and binds our planets, stars, and galaxies together. Many people have unsuccessfully theorized about the details of gravity and its relationship to other forces. No links have been established between gravity waves and electromagnetic radiation.

\item Gravity is theorized to warp space and time. In fact, gravity is responsible for bending light as observed by the gravity-lens example of distant galaxies.

\item ``Gravitational waves" appear as ripples in space-time. Long theorized, a gravitational wave was first detected in 2015, and was caused by the merger of two black holes 1.4 billion light years away.

\item The speed with which gravity propagates through space has not yet been determined.
